# TMI, the ~~Hyper~~Text Markup Idiom

An HTML markup syntax that looks good when it's raw and rendered.

Specifically, this is the core engine built in Node.js.

DEVELOPER NOTES:
This is a todo project, I will not be returning to this for some time. My initial brainstorm for this project: I want it to be a web-first, HTML-first alternative to things like [Markdown], [AsciiDoc], [Textile], etc. I see a lot of good ideas comming from them syntax wise. The problem I'm trying to solve: I'd like a markup language I can use to document all my code. One that's universally available and can be used within the comment syntax of all the languages I use on the daily so I can optimize commenting and documenting my projects by combining the two processes, similar to the [Sphinx] method in python since I take forever long to type documentation as is :grimacing:. Hopefully, once I return to and finish this project, my productivity will be marginally improved. As far as licensing goes, I'm not sure yet whether or not I want to use the MPL or something else, while I'm deciding, I'm using the MIT license. If I do use the MPL, it will be a version that I personally moderate though my own LLC once I get my small buisness license. Which won't be too far down the road. But we'll see.
