As a response to the above video, perhaps it'd be a good idea to add an ad-censor feature to the browser, or as a supplement to existing ad-blockers.
I've been poor most of my life and there is genuine merit to denying servces money. Plus unblocking ads is a pain and we all hate them. So why not
turn the world into a distributed botnet for ad-revenue generation while blocking them?

The idea of ad-censor, which would probably need to be implemented natively into browsers since JS leaves behind metadata that ad scripts could use to
heuristically map what ads are getting through, is this: With a website toggle list, block ads from view, attempt to click on them and generate money from
them in some way, keep the ad posters happy by allowing them to believe they're getting genuine views and clicks and such, and have a better browser experince
knowing you're supporting content creators you like.

As an additional feature, using a genetic or AI algorithm to reduce wasted ad clock cycles through ad emulation would be nice. Since they waste a lot of the world's
power.

If it were sucessful, it could break the web by disincentivizing ad purchasers, but the endless streams of corporate propaganda arguably make the web a worse place.
It could cost the world a lot of services being taken offline, but returning to the early days of the internet, with blogs and such being more common,
could be nice.
