#Source Code

Let's make this short.

Put everything you intend to compile, or interpret in your project as code that
does not belong in any other folder. Also, only put code in this folder.
Doing anything else is against the codestruct

Bla blah blah.

Just make sure you can build your project without issues from the root dir of
the repo. However you organize the code in this folder is up to you.
