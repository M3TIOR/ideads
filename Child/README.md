It's been too long since I visited this project/idea,
even though, I'm pretty sure I would have made the name be
an acronym of sorts in the past; for the life of me I can't
remember what that would be...

I've wished for a lot of my life, that a machine could live.
Have to admit, my curiosity was peaked at the idea of having
played god in some wicked display of wits and wonder.
A live machine. An inorganic wish made reality. This project
upon completion will be my wish come true. If I can complete
it anyway. Much like many of my other projects I expect it to
be put on hold and in the back of my mind for quite some time
before I'll return to it. So in the mean time. I'll just
leave my ideas here.
