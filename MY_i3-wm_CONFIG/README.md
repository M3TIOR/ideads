# M3-I3
Hello all, Thanks again for taking the time to look at my various works of blah. I can't call them works of art because I'm too romantic for that. Don't you just love my humor?

:P

Anyway, Just thought I'd drop this in my github.

M3-I3 is my configuration for the window manager I use on my programming laptop and that can be found here.

* [i3 Window Manager](http://i3wm.org)

My config does have some dependencies that I hope you can forgive me for.

* feh
* xbacklight
* pactl
* nm-applet

are all the current dependencies for my build, which I'm kinda too lazy to fix right now. I'll get on that later maybe. But anyway, here's a screenshot of what you get.

I don't really know if maybe I'm just using public access as an excuse to backup my work cause I'm too lazy to do that ever. God, I really need to come up with some even better reasons not to do my work, I'm beginning to think I'm actually being productive!

Realistically though, anyone with a little knowledge of the i3 window manager or enough time and effort to Google their configuration docs can make this themselves with enough motivation.

This particular model is configured for the Acer Chromebook CB3-111 with the alt key controlling I3 and the FN keys bound for screen brightness, sound, and screen sharing to HDMI with F5 on workspace 10/0 : whichever name you prefer it have, it's default bound to alt+0.

Anyway, have at it. I'll probably get mad at myself later for making this so static and redo it so you can modify it to your liking at the install step.

Toodles,

PS: I did make everything in this package myself, excluding the auto-generated configs for I3 and the unliscense for redistirbution even if it's not a lot.
