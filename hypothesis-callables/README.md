# hypothesis-callables
Strategies for generating dynamic HypothesisWorks compliant python callables. 

## Note
This project is no longer maintained and will not be suggested for merge into hypothesis.works
Six months after I got sidetracked, Hypothesis got callables implemented natively
within the library. This archive exists as to catalogue my work on the project alone; it's non-functional.
