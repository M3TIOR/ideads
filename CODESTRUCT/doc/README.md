# Documentation

 > Oh, look you've found the documentation folder! *plays LoZ item fanfare*

Ah yes, the wonderful documentation folder. A place where all knowledge about
your project will eventually been found. Of course you don't have to host your
documentation in this folder. But please, have the courtesy to make it available
to all your users.

Quite self-explanitory, no?

### Just a quick side note:

Please for the love of all that pertains to your moral scope. Excluding wikis;
don't have redundant documentation! It's a waste of resources, and most likely
a waste of your, or someone else's time.
