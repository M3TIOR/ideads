# Binaries

Quite simply put, this is the landing station for any binaries you want to
*"distribute with"* or *"are necessary for"* your repository. The inner directory
structure can be as obfuscated and ambiguous as you wish, so long as your repo
uses the folder appropriately.

Realistically, it is advised that no repository packages raw executable binaries
with it. Specifically because doing such takes up extra space in a repository
that should belong exclusively to source code. *But also, I want to leave this as
a warning to people who support [M3TIOR]'s philosophy; that anyone should be able
to use an application they built directly from it's source:* ***Do not trust
repositories that include pre-built binaries which aren't outsourced from
trusted distributors.*** Doing so can allow malicious code to be executed on
your machine.

[We]( "The Darklight-Dev Team" ) are not held responsible for any malicious
code you contract from building repositories that use our repository format
which are also not distributed by us.

We put every ounce of effort into protecting our users from malicious
content. Thus why every project we host is completely open-source and free
to use. Using pre-built binaries in a project we host should always be
totally optional. **Hopefully [M3TIOR] will eventually get off her arse long
enough to make a system for which we can distribute pre-built binaries with
the security of our users being able to ensure they're completely safe.**

### Until then:

With love, *Darklight-Dev*
