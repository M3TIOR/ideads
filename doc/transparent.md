# Transparent

A website for non-profits to make their transaction history public. (Credibility engine) 

Or at least it could have been. I thought about making this project back in 2018, I was a
little less politically educated back then. I didn't have the time to invest in this project.
But at this point in my life I also doubt it would have caught any eyes.
