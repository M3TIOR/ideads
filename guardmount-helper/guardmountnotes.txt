Be a Defensive Driver! Take things slow.                                        Come to a complete stop before you scan QR codes!                               Make sure you're scanning a QR code every time you do something significant.    Make sure to check your district memos. This goes for new employees especially. For the sake of transparency: if you need to 10-21, why? Can OIC assist?        Try and at least do one report per night. Show you're working!                  Make sure you're timing your lunches and clocking in and out on time.           Clean out your vehicles when fueling! I don't want to clean your junk.          Make sure you're clocking out on time and not before.                           Don't forget to turn in your car keys before you leave!                         Roll your vehicle windows up before you leave.                                  Let your OIC know if you cannot complete your district.                         Don't scribble on or color over the QR Codes!                                   If you encounter a breach in a normally secured property have the RP advise     Onsite checks are a priority hit, even if you're splitting.                     When you go 97/98 let Dispatch & OIC know property, where, and who.             When you go 97/98 let Dispatch & OIC know what property you're at.              When you go 10-10 let Dispatch & OIC know where U R & who U R talking to.       Make sure if your property has an entry gate that it's secured before you depart!
