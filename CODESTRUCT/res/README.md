#The resources folder, you have found.

Bringing you this documentation, Yoda is.

This is the folder where you put resources for your repository. Things that
aren't code, and executable binaries. Images, music, video clips that belong
in your App all belong here. I wish there were more to say.

We at the Darklight-Dev group will not be putting any sound clips
exceeding 10 minutes in duration, images over 4k resolution, or video content
within our repositories. It is recommended that anyone else taking up our
repository structure do the same to eliminate excessive junk on github.
If you're hosting the repo on a private server than by all means do as you wish.
Any resources or binaries that are necessary for Darklight-Dev's repos will be
hosted as extension repos downloaded at build time from a private server.

And no, I don't care that git has it's own compression method. A one hour HD
video exceeding 1GB in size doesn't need to be stored on github!

Good luck to you all.
