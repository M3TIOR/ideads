	Finally starting this darn project...
	I mean really?!?!?!?!
	I made the repository two years ago! WTF ME?
	
	Oh, and to any new onlookers, I'm going to warn you now
	because github has it's own versioning system I don't really do
	formal update logs unless I'm doing a large project.
	So be prepaired for this thing to be filled with tons of hogwash!
