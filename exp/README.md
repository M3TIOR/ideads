# Explorer 

So this was written back when I was the kind of person to think a new OS should be built
using the latest programming language I was using. I also kinda had a bit of a kerfuffle
when realizing that the shell commands and graphical file explorer were two separate
binaries. I couldn't, for the life of me, understand why.

Like most of my project from way-back-when, this is mostly unfinished. I don't see a need
to have a GUI and navigational shell scripts unified anymore.
