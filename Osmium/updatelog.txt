M3TIOR 2015

March,3 2015:
	Project begins. Mbr loaded and tested
	
	Proposed new Idea, no global partitioning table, instead, A filesystem capable of supporting
	subsystems. Reducing the yeald of a mbr and increasing the efficiency of disk space.
	
	I should probably log that to AstroFS card on trello...

March,14 2015:
	Project reformated. stuff happens and I'm happy about that.
	
	To Elaborate a little, I added some dev tools.
	
	More are coming in the future as I need them so be prepaired for that.
	As for the rest of the project I have yet to actually start.
	I figured I should make my job easier before I begin the project
	so I don't have to do it later. Plus if any of you wonderful people
	need the tools they're here for yeh.

March,19 2015:
	Ok, so there's a thing that I just had to learn...
	I'm going to have to target x86 systems and above!
	Weeeeeeew right!.... no, I fucking hate it...
	because now I can't keep the promise of the project...
