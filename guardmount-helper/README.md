## Warning
This project is no longer maintained, guardmount was the meeting I had with my co-workers when I
was a manager for the security agency Knighthawk Protection. I'm archiving this to track my previous
work and for that sole purpose alone. Hope this helps you if you need it :heart:

# guardmount-helper
A simple application to help me manage guardmount better!
I kinda decided one day that I needed a better management system to help
me run guardmount better, mark notes and all. This system is implemented to do
so!

Unfortunately, I'm going to be running this on my phone using Termux because
I didn't really feel like getting used to beeware and adding another roadblock
to having this ready. Since whenever I do large projects I seem to slow down
significantly after the second or third day of working on it, adding any extra
work would make this take way longer to push out. As such it's a bit hacky and
nowhere near fleshed out into anything noteworthy but it's still operable
enough to serve the purpose it's intended to. So mission accomplished!

As of right now, I don't plan on this becomming a big project or even adding
many more features. Hell, I probably won't even add in the curses GUI mode.
I already have too many projects backlogged and an addition to the hypothesis
library that I'm working on. This project is MIT licensed, and the license is
annotated in the comments of the python code.

*In the words of an angry black woman:* ***I ain't
got no time for that!***

#### ***Current features include***:
 * [x] ability to expand breifing reminders
 * [x] prints breifing note summary
 * [x] reminder for timesheets on weekends
 * [ ] curses interactive mode
