TODO project: inspect binaries as bitmaps, add plugins for stream filters PNG JPEG etc.


I don't remember what it was supposed to stand for. That is supposed to be an abbreviation
but whatever. Also inspecting binaries as bitmaps sounds cool but arbitrary data tends
to just like static. Soooo even if this could have been cool, I don't feel like the effort
would be worth it.
